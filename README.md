# data-analysis-tableau

This is a data analysis project with a visualization created on tableau. I first imported the data from a transactional sql data base to a analytical sql data base. Then I did some data cleaning in sql. Then I used tableau to connect to the sql data base and used tableau to create a visualization of the data in the sql data base. And this visualization is made according to the demand of the user so the user can better view data combined with user's own subject mater expertise make judgements on how to make better actionable business decisions. 

The visualization is in the pdf file.
